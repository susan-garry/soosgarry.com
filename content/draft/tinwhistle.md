At the beginning of December '24, I injured my knee and was unable to walk properly or exercise for two and a half months. As I was unable to exercise, I decided to learn a musical instrument instead. The beautiful thing about Irish tin whistle is that excellent musicians hold jam sessions around the world (including sunny Ithaca), so you don't have to spend all your time playing alone trying not to bother your neighbors - you can bother world-class musicians as well!

### Why Learn Tin Whistle
- __Cost__: The cheapest tin whistles sell for about $15 at the local guitar store. However, it will be less frustrating to learn on a decent tin whistle, which sell for around $50 (I love playing [Jerry Freeman's blackbird whistle][]). 
- __Community__: If you're trying to learn guitar or cello, you could spend hours practicing alone without clear opportunities for joining musical groups and sharing your hobby with other people. [The Session] catalogues local Irish music sessions around the world so that you can find a group of like-minded friends to rock out with.
-__Music__: Irish music is fun, fast, upbeat, wistful and humorous, and has become my supportive and encouraging companion when I clean my house or struggle to wake up in the mornings. Here's my [spotify playlist] for a *brief* introduction to the genre that biases toward tin whistle.
-__Low Barrier to Entry__: I've been playing tin whistle on an off for three months and am already at a level where I can play (a meager handful) of tunes comfortably with other musicians (they haven't kicked me out yet!). Like any musical instrument, it takes practice and dedication to get good, but the amount of time it takes to be able to play entire songs is much lower than that of other musical instruments

### How Learn Tin Whistle

The first place to start is grabbing a whistle and learning how to play all of the notes on it. I recommend looking for introductory tutorials online - anything that takes you through the first two octaves will do (yes, it plays many octaves). The Online Academy of Irish Music is a good place to get started - here's their [first video] in their free series on learning to play tin whistle.

Once you know how to play all of the notes, try learning a tune or two! I recommend starting with something that you already enjoy listening to you, but be aware that Irish tin whistles are usually in the key of D, so for now, stick to tunes in D Major. I started with holiday tunes like Auld Lang Syne, the Holly and the Ivy, and Here We Come A-wassailing. There are a few ways to learn:
- __By ear__: Also known as __trial and error__. Just pick up the whistle and start playing until you find the right notes! When you get good at this, you can listen to any song and learn it without needing to see the music written down.
- __Sheet Music__:
- __Tabs__: [Tin whistle tabs] are diagrams that show you which fingers to put down in order to play each note in the tune. Some of them even have notations that tell you how long to play each note. 

### Go Forth and Conquer
This entire blog post is about learning irish music on tin whistle. But - you can play any genre on tin whistle. (See [], who plays tin whistle to blues music!) Above all else, you should play the music (and the instruments) that *you* enjoy
