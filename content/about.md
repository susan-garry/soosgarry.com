Hello! This is Soos Garry. I started my PhD at Cornell University in Fall 2023, and I am working with [Adrian Sampson][adrian] and [capra][] on DSLs and compilers.

**Research&nbsp;** I am currently working on [Pollen][], a DSL for [pangenomic graph][] queries.

**Personal&nbsp;** I am a total swing dance (lindy hop) nerd. I teach the Intro to Swing PE class at Cornell and regularly travel around the world for social dances and workshop weekends. Completely unrelated to this, I recently start playing Irish tin whistle! Catch me at [The Watershed] for live performances.
